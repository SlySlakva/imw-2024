    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>For this interactive assignment I thought it would be fun to make lotus flowers bloom whenever a mouse hovered
        over them. I find these flowers particularly beautiful because of their ability to thrive in challenging
        environments. I really appreciate their diverse colors and symbolic meanings of rebirth and resilience. To start
        with this assignment, I first wanted to create the environment for these flowers.

    <h2>2. Water and Lily Pads</h2>
    <p>Lotus flowers grow in muddied water among an abundance of water lilies, so creating those elements was my first
        priority. I decided to go with a gradient theme early on to emulate the vibrant colors better. This meant that
        for the water, I used a blue to near-black gradient to create a sense of depth. I animated the position of the
        gradient to make it continuously change and a sense of movement. </p>
    <p>I started with circles to create the water lilies, but after some brief experimentation, I switched over to a
        cartoon image. This allowed me to customize the lily pad easily since I could open photoshop and quickly test
        different visuals. I added a gradient mask and some subtle shadows to create something interesting. </p>

    <p>Once I made my water lily, I added a floating animation to the overall element. This made it seem like the wit
        was floating along the water surface. I later changed the duration of the animation so the water lilies would
        float at different paces. </p>

    <h2>3. Creating the Flower</h2>
    <p>Creating the flower was the hardest part of the process. I first created a container called flower that would
        contain all the petals, leaves, and root. I used a border radius to create the shape of the petals. I then tried
        to spread them apart. Figuring out the rotation and position for each one was rather tedious. I used transform
        origin to make the rotation easier. But I eventually went searching for a simple code that would spread the
        petals out evenly. I came across this which helped me achieve that desired effect:</p>
    <p>transform: scale(1.2) rotate(var(--petal-rotate));</p>

    <p>I later had to id some petals specifically to resize them and move them down. This was to create a foreshortening
        effect and give a sense of depth. I did the same with the leaves by giving each one a unique id and flipping +
        rotating them to spread out beneath the blooming flower:
    </p>
    <p> transform: scaleX(-1) rotate(170deg)translate(25px, 0px);</p>
    <p>I added a root as well to connect the flower to the water. I used a gradient that allows the root to fade into
        the depths easily. </p>
    <p>Once I created the flower, I need to figure out how to resize it. I wanted to make sure I can do it without
        changing the petals themselves. This was to prevent them of changing their specific positions. I ended up using
        a scale command in the flower container </p>

    <h2>4. Randomizer</h2>
    <p>I used a couple randomizing factors for this assignment. One of them was actually reused from a previous excerise
        I did a couple weeks ago. I used a createElement function to randomize where the flowers would appear. It was
        convenient because the flower has a lot of children elements with precise rotation and positions. By creating a
        parent with a random position, and then later appending all these specific children, I was able to multiple the
        number of flowers without having to fix up each one’s appearance.</p>
    <p>I used a simpler randomizer function for the lily pads since it didn’t require any children elements.</p>
    <p> I also used a color randomizer function to assign each flower a different color. I first created an array that
        contained a list of gradients. I referenced an image to pick these colors. Then after picking an array number,
        it would apply the color to the newly created flower.

    <h2>5. Final Result</h2>
    <p>After cleaning up the code a bit I finally had this result. </p>
